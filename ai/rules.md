# Template System Architecture

## PHP Controllers and Twig Views

The template system follows a controller-view pattern:

1. **PHP Template Files (`*.php`)**
   - Act as controllers
   - Located in `site/templates/`
   - Filename matches the ProcessWire template name
   - No need to initialize Twig (enabled by default)
   - Core ProcessWire variables (`$page`, `$pages`, etc.) are automatically available in Twig
   - Custom data can be passed to views using `$view->set()`
   ```php
   // Example: Passing custom data to view
   $view->set('nav_items', $pages->get('/')->children());
   ```

2. **Twig Templates (`*.html.twig`)**
   - Act as views
   - Located in `site/templates/twig/`
   - Filename matches the PHP template name
   - Access to all core ProcessWire variables
   - Can use custom data passed from controller
   - Extends base layouts and includes components
   ```twig
   {# Example: Using core and custom variables #}
   {% extends "layouts/base.html.twig" %}
   
   {% block content %}
     <h1>{{ page.title }}</h1>
     <nav>
       {% for item in nav_items %}
         <a href="{{ item.url }}">{{ item.title }}</a>
       {% endfor %}
     </nav>
   {% endblock %}
   ```

## Best Practices

1. **Keep Controllers Lean**
   - Controllers should only prepare data
   - Avoid logic in controllers that belongs in Page classes
   - Use `$view->set()` for passing custom data

2. **Structure Views Properly**
   - Use template inheritance (`extends`)
   - Break down into components
   - Keep presentation logic in Twig
   - Use proper escaping

3. **Variable Access**
   - Core ProcessWire variables available by default:
     - `page`: Current page
     - `pages`: Pages API
     - `config`: Configuration
     - `user`: Current user
     - `languages`: Languages (if enabled)
     - `sanitizer`: Sanitizer functions

I will follow these instructions to ensure high-quality implementation. I will always seek confirmation for any unclear points or when important decisions are needed. I will start every response with "âœ¨âœ¨âœ¨". Every time I am assigned a task I will look for matching documentation links. If there are I will state it with "ðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥" and the documentation link title.
